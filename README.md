To run in Tuffix, the environment used for grading, navigate the console to the root directory and execute Build.sh via the command "./Build.sh".

If you get any issues related to permissions, you can fix it with the command "chmod 777 Build.sh" (7 being bitwise 111, giving all Read/Write/eXecute permissions we may need)

The results will produce an executable file using both clang++ and g++, with a large number of compiler flags already set.
